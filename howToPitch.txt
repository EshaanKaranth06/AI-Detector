his is a classic engineering interview challenge: How do you sell a system that has a perceived limitation (dependency on data)?

The key is to reframe the "limitation" as a strategic design choice. You aren't building a "Google Search" for plagiarism; you are building an "Internal Forensic Tool."

Here is exactly how to pitch this, broken down by the type of questions you will get.

1. The "Elevator Pitch" (The Hook)
When they ask: "Tell me about this project."

"I built a Hybrid Semantic Plagiarism Detector designed to catch sophisticated evasion techniques that standard ATS and keyword scanners miss.

Most detectors just look for matching words. My system uses Vector Embeddings (E5) and AI scoring (BLEURT) to detect when someone has stolen the meaning or structure of a document, even if they’ve rewritten every single sentence. It’s designed to stop 'Resume Recycling' and 'Identity Theft' in high-volume hiring pipelines."

2. Handling the "Huge Corpus" Objection (The Pivot)
When they ask: "But doesn't this require a massive database of millions of documents to work?"

Your Answer: "That’s a great observation. I designed this specifically as a Closed-Loop Verification System, not a web crawler. It solves a specific enterprise problem: Internal Data Integrity."

Give these 3 Use Cases to prove why "Small Corpus" is valuable:

The "Recycled Candidate" Problem: "Large tech companies receive 2 million resumes a year. Many candidates get rejected, change their name, rewrite their resume using AI, and re-apply. My system catches them against the company's own database of past applicants."

University Admissions: "Universities don't need to check against the whole internet; they primarily need to check if a student copied a past year's submission from the same university's archive."

Privacy-First Architecture: "Unlike cloud solutions where you send private data to a third party, this system runs locally on an organization's internal vectors. It protects data privacy while securing the hiring pipeline."

3. The "Tech Flex" (Showing off the Logic)
When they ask: "How is this different from checking TF-IDF or cosine similarity?"

"I implemented a Multi-Gate Architecture because simple Cosine Similarity is too noisy. I treat Plagiarism as three different attack vectors:"

Attack 1: The Copy-Paste.

My Solution: "I use N-Grams and TF-IDF. If they copy exact technical stacks, this catches it instantly."

Attack 2: The AI Rewrite (Thesaurus Attack).

My Solution: "I use E5 Embeddings + BLEURT. Even if they change 'Managed SQL Database' to 'Administered Relational DB,' the vector distance remains close. BLEURT confirms they are semantically identical."

Attack 3: The Identity Theft (Structure Attack).

My Solution: "This was the hardest. I built a Pattern Accumulator. If a document has 4 or 5 'weak' matches from the same source file, the system recognizes a pattern of theft, even if no single sentence is a strong match. This catches people who steal a resume structure but change the details."

4. The "Results" (The Closer)
When they ask: "How do you know it works?"

"I stress-tested it against adversarial attacks. I generated 'Original' resumes and then created variants using Semantic Paraphrasing, Structural Scrambling, and Information Compression.

Standard methods failed to link the variants.

My system successfully linked the Semantic Paraphrase with a confidence score of 64% and flagged the Structural Scrambler as 'Identity Theft' based on pattern density, all while maintaining a near-zero False Positive rate for legitimate resumes."

Summary Checklist for the Interview
[ ] Don't apologize for the database requirement. It's a feature for internal security.

[ ] Highlight the "Pattern Logic." That is your most unique code contribution (the source_hit_map logic).

[ ] Mention "False Positives." Engineers love hearing that you care about not flagging innocent users. Mention the "Dynamic Thresholds" you built to ignore common industry jargon.

"I didn't build a tool to scan the internet. I built a forensic tool to secure an organization's internal data pipeline." -> That is the winning line.
